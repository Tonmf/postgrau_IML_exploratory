    "Use headings and documentation in Markdown cells to structure your notebook and explain your workflow steps. Remember: You’re not only doing this for your colleagues or your successor, but also for your future self.\n",
    "The toc2 extension can automatically create heading numbers and a Table of Contents, both in a sidebar (optionally a floating window) and in a markdown cell. The highlighting indicates your current position in the document — this will help you keep oriented in long notebooks.\n",
    "The Collapsible Headings extension allows you to hide entire sections of code, thereby letting you focus on your current workflow stage.\n",
    "This default template extension causes notebooks to not be created empty, but with a default structure and common imports. Also, it will repeatedly ask you to change the name from Untitled.ipynb to something meaningful.\n",

It is best to install them using [Jupyter NBextensions Configurator](https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator#installation) and [Jupyter Notebook Extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions).

    "1. [**Autopep8**](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/code_prettify/README_autopep8.html). Reformats code to fix basic spacing errors that do not follow PEP-8 guidelines. See [PEP-8 documentation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) for detailed style guidelines. Probably we need to install the _autopep8_ package for this extension to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [**Spellchecker**](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/spellchecker/README.html#) Highlights incorrectly spelled words in Markdown and Raw cells. It is very helpful in identifying misspelled words, especially when all your text, code, and LaTeX seem to be running together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [**Execute Time**](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/execute_time/readme.html) It is a helpful reminder of what has and has not been executed as you switch between notebooks. It displays a line at the bottom of your code block that tells you\n",
    "  - the date and time the last execution of the code cell occurred\n",
    "  - how long it took to execute\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The timing information allows us to assess how long it would take to re-run the cell, but  also avoids importing the `Time` or `Timeit` libraries to time the code execution.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "4. [**Notify**](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/notify/readme.html) Displays a web notification in the top right hand corner of your screen when the kernel becomes idle, meaning the code has finished running. The _Notify_ drop-down menu in the Jupyter Notebook toolbar allows you to disable the feature or select notifications for code that takes longer than 0, 5, 10, or 30 seconds to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. [**Skip-Traceback**](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/skip-traceback/readme.html) Hides error tracebacks and instead only displays a summary that includes error name and type. If you want to view the full traceback, you can click the triangle/drop-down arrow at the end of the summary to unhide the traceback.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. [**Variable inspector**](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/varInspector/README.html) Collects all defined variables and display them in a floating window.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. [**Scratchpad**](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/scratchpad/README.html) Opens a cell that acts like a scratch notebook where you can execute code against the kernel without having to modify your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. [**Snippets Menu**](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/snippets_menu/readme.html) Adds a menu item to your Jupyter Notebook where you can search for snippets, boilerplate, and examples of code to insert into your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. [**Initialization Cells**](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/init_cell/README.html) Allows you to mark cells as _initialization cells_ that will run automatically when the notebook is opened or when clicking the initialization button in the toolbar. Note that the first time you open a notebook with initialization cells enabled, a warning will display saying the notebook is untrusted. You can choose to trust the notebook, after which the notebook will re-open in trusted mode and run your initialization cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. [**Code font size**](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/code_font_size/README.html) Adds toolbar buttons to increase and decrease code's font size (this is useful, for example, when projecting the notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. [**Code folding**](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/codefolding/readme.html) Allows code folding within cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. [**Collapsible Headings**](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/collapsible_headings/readme.html) Organize your notebook into collapsible sections indicated by markdown heading sections. You can indicate up to 6 heading levels in your markdown by using hashtags `#`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. [**Table of contents (2)**](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/toc2/README.html) Last, but not least, this extension displays the index of collapsible headings in a floating window or as a docked sidebar. We can use the table of contents to scroll through the notebook, jump to specific sections, and collapse sections.\n",
